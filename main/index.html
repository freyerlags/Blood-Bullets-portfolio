        <h2>What was the point of me making Bolts and Bullets?</h2>
     <p>The whole reason why I decided to make Bolts and Bullets was because I wanted to play a DND based game but I didnt like how each time I played it a character had some demon or menecing background. I didnt like this because I am a fellow christian and when I thought of this I really liked the idea of detroit become human and robot revalution. So with thought and time plus some patience I finally decided to make this a thing.</p>
